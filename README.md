# InHabit

User interface to InHabit app which promotes engagement in activities towards sustainability.

The user interface has the 3 modules:
- Dashboard: Allows you to track your streak and participation in events and activities around your city through  rewards and comparison among citizens
- Events: List and filter events which are held around the city and relevant to the user
- Petitions: Awareness of issues and raising voice by supporting the concerns towards a sustainable future
- Authentication: Authenticates user

The modules rely on APIs from the backend application credits [Backend Repository](https://github.com/glanzz/credits)

The future expansion of the project involves:
  - Expanding and modularizing the code
  - Adopt mechanisms and modules to allow the best usage of the credits earned
  - Integrate with Govt schemes and corporations as a support system
