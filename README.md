# InHabit

The InHabit project was conceived out of a concern for urban sustainability, aiming to bridge the gap between city living and environmental consciousness. The web app encourages users to participate in green initiatives and sustainability events organized by governmental and non-governmental organizations. Users earn points and rewards for engaging in these activities. Developed using Python, MySQL, React, CSS, JavaScript, and Figma, the project prioritized user feedback and iterative design to shape its features. Challenges included ensuring data privacy compliance and maintaining user engagement amidst competition. Despite these hurdles, the team takes pride in creating a platform that promotes environmental stewardship and community connection. Lessons learned include the significance of user-centric design and the impact of gamification on behaviour change. Moving forward, plans involve incentivizing green purchases, tracking individual carbon footprints, facilitating group impact tracking and reporting, fostering community collaboration, and incentivizing government services for sustainable living.

The InHabit project was submitted to the **Tech For Change: Civic Tech Hackathon 2024**, demonstrating its commitment to addressing societal challenges through innovative technology solutions.

The InHabit app's user interface comprises three key modules:

1. Dashboard: Monitor your engagement and progress in sustainability-related events and activities across your city. Earn rewards, track your participation streak, and compare your efforts with fellow citizens.
2. Events: Explore a comprehensive list of events in your city that align with sustainability goals. Filter events based on relevance and interests to ensure you're always informed and involved.
3. Petitions: Stay informed about pressing sustainability issues and lend your voice by supporting petitions to build a more sustainable future for all.

Additionally, the app features an authentication system to ensure secure access for users.

The functionality of each module within the InHabit app relies on APIs from the backend application, credited to the [Backend Repository](https://github.com/glanzz/credits) These APIs provide the necessary data and services to power features such as the Dashboard, Events, Petitions, and Authentication, ensuring seamless integration and enhanced user experience.

The future expansion of the project involves:
1. Expand and modularize the codebase for scalability and maintainability.
2. Implement mechanisms and modules to optimize the utilization of earned credits, enhancing user experience.
3. Integrate with government schemes and corporate initiatives to provide additional support and resources for users' sustainability efforts.
